Improvement ideas: 
- Make robots start from the center of the maze.
- Make experimental validations of guarantees of the form 2n/k + kD and, also, test the logarithmic guarantees. 
  - Might need for external contributor for this. 
- CTE. implement the actual distributed algo, where you have to wait for robots to come back before going up
- LGA. Implement our own actually distributed algo


Other implementations: 
- For random games: create a green/red matrix representing 1 /  -1, let the user pick rows and try to win
