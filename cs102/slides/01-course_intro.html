## Background (CS 101)

This is a challenging course that builds on concepts learned in CSCI.UA 101 (Introduction to computer science). You need to be familiar with:

- Programming basics in Java (variables, data types, methods, classes, objects, etc.)

--

- Control flow constructs (if, for, while, switch, etc.)

--

- Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc.)

--

- Running, compiling, and debugging Java programs

--

- Basic algorithms (searching, recursion, etc.)

--

We will do a quick review of some of these concepts (week 1 and 2), and the rest of the class will build on them.

# How to succeed?

## Tips for the Course

- __Understand the concepts and reasons for doing things__. Do not memorize things if you do not
know what they are doing. Question things! Be curious!

--

- __Use pen and paper__ (or the modern equivalents). Draw things out and experiment with the ideas. It often helps to
draw out variables and objects of a piece of code that you are analyzing and update the picture as you go through
the code. This type of hand-eye interaction stimulates different parts of your brain and helps you learn!

--

- __Try solving problems yourself__. I mean really work them out BEFORE asking for a solution,
looking at a solution posted by others or trying to search the web/LLM.

--

- __Write code solutions yourself__. Don't copy and paste, type code yourself and then compare it to the code we
wrote in class or the code that is in a book.

--

- __Treat mistakes and bugs as your friends__. The more problems you encounter, the easier it is to
recognize them in the future. 

--

- __Make friends__. Make sure that you meet at least a few other people in the class and get to
know them. These friendships will benefit you and other people in the class, and, in some case, may
last a lifetime.

## Data Structures and Algorithms
### What are they?

--


A __data structure__ is a collection of data items in a memory of a running program that
are organized in some fashion and that are accessed/modified by some fixed methods. 

An __algorithm__ is a sequence of instructions computable in a finite amount of time and space.


--

.left-column2[
Examples of data structures from CSCI.UA 101:
- __array__: data items are stored one after another in memory and they can be accessed by
their index number,

- __stack__: collection of items with access (add/remove) only at the _top_ of the stack.
]

.right-column2[
Data structures covered in CSCI.UA 102:
- __list__
- __stack__
- __queue__
- __tree__
- __binary search tree__
- __hash table__
- __some graphs__
- ...
]

--

.left-column2[
Examples of algorithms from CSCI.UA 101:
- __maximum:__ computing the maximum of an __array__

- __reverse:__ reversing the elements of a __stack__

# Why Learn to Write Code If AI Can Do It?

---

template:slide

## Understanding Is Fundamental
### .purple[AI Can’t Learn for You]

AI can generate code, but only your personal intellectual effort can **teach you what the code means**.

--

When you write code yourself, you practice:

- Breaking down complex problems into smaller ones 

- Thinking step-by-step  

- Translating ideas into logic and syntax  

--

These skills are central to **software design, algorithms, systems, and research**.

--

These skills are also central to **instructing AI to code solutions to more complex problems**.

- Debug code when something breaks  

- Adapt code to a new use case  

- Choose the right data structure for a new problem  

--

My advice: __Use AI to help you learn, but do not copy-paste code to solve homeworks.__

--

More generally, don’t skip **building core skills**. **Do not ask AI to complete tasks that you would not be able to complete on your own.**


---

## You Can’t Debug What You Do not Understand

Even if AI writes the code, you need to:

- Read and understand it  

- Fix bugs  

- Test to make sure that the code does what it claims it does 

- Optimize performance  

To do that, you must understand how data structures and algorithms work under the hood, and you must know the programming language that you are working with.

---

## Foundational Skills Enable Advanced Learning

- You do not learn advanced calculus without first understanding and mastering basics of arithmetic. 

- You do not write a bestseller novel without first learning how to write letters of the alphabet. 

- You do not win Tour De France without first learning how to ride a kiddie bike. 

--

Understanding data structures and basics of programming languages unlocks:

- Systems programming  

- Algorithm design  

- Machine learning  

- Cybersecurity  

- Software architecture  

- ... and many more 

---

##  Employers and Interviews Expect It

Many technical interviews still require:

- Writing code on the spot  

- Explaining time and space complexity  

- Implementing or using basic data structures  

**In real jobs, you’ll often need to build custom solutions—not just copy-paste from AI. That's because these solutions may be
new and unique to a given situation and the AI does not _know_ about them yet.**


---

## Final Thought

> Use AI to *learn*, not to *replace* learning.

If you master the fundamentals, AI makes you faster and better.

If you don’t, it just makes you faster at being confused and then you become easily replaceable by AI.

[**Linus Torvals **](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), 2006:

> .Large["I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he(/she) considers his(/her) code or his(/her) data structures more important. 
Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. "]

## Demo 1: Create a string with lots of 'a's.

.left-column2-larger[ 
.smaller[
```Java
String generateAString1(int number) {
    // Declare and instantiate variable to hold result
    String result = "";
    //Loop
    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        // concatenate
        result += "a"; 
    }
    return result;
}
```

```Java
String generateAString2(int number) {
    // Declare and instantiate variable to hold result
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    // Loop
    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        // Concatenate
        sb.append('a');
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
```
]
]

.right-column2-smaller[

- We want to create a chain of characters (String) with a given (as input) number of "a".

- Which program is faster? https://pollev.com/cosson
]

template: demo1a
name: demo1b

.right-column2-smaller[

- When `number` = 500,000:
    - the first function takes about __20 seconds__ 
    - the second function takes only __2.5 milliseconds__

]

--

.below-column2[

.purple[Why such a big difference?]
- one needs to look at _how_ the `String` and `StringBuilder` classes are implemented
- and to understand what data structures and algorithms each class uses

]

## Demo 2: Iterating over a list of numbers


.left-column2-larger[
.smaller[

```Java
List<Integer> doubleList1(List<Integer> numbers){
    // Instantiate list for result
    List<Integer> twiceNumbers = new List<>();
    // Loop 
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size; i++) {
        // Compute i-th element
        twiceNumbers.addLast(numbers.get(i) * 2 );
    return twiceNumbers;
}
```




```Java

List<Integer> doubleList2(List<Integer> numbers){
    // Instantiate list for result
    List<Integer> twiceNumbers = new List<>();
    // Loop 
    for (int num : numbers ) {
        // Compute i-th element
        twiceNumbers.addLast( num * 2 );
    }
    return twiceNumbers;
}
```
]
]


.right-column2-smaller[

- The program doubles all elements in a list of integers.

- Which program is faster? https://pollev.com/cosson

]

--

When `size` = 100,000 program 1 takes __4 seconds__ to execute
and program 2 finishes in __~4 milliseconds__.

.left-column2-large[

- __Question:__ Would there be a difference in runtime if the datastructure was an __array__ of integers? https://pollev.com/cosson
]

## Demo 3: Calculating Fibonacci Numbers

.left-column2[

Calculate the N'th Fibonacci number recursively: 

```Java
public static long fibonacci1 (
                  long number ) {
    //base case
    if (number == 0 )
        return 0;
    else if (number == 1 )
        return 1;
    //recursive case
    else
        return fibonacci1(number - 1)
             + fibonacci1(number - 2);
}
```
]

.right-column2[

Calculate the N'th Fibonacci number iteratively: 

```Java
public static long fibonacci2 (
                  long number ) {
    //base case
    if (number == 0 )
        return 0;
    else if (number == 1 )
        return 1;
    //iteratively compute the result
    else {
        long tmp1 = 0;
        long tmp2 = 1;
        long result = 0;
        int counter = 2;
        while ( counter <= number) {
            result = tmp1 + tmp2;
            tmp1 = tmp2;
            tmp2  = result;
            counter++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

.smaller[
- Which program is faster? https://pollev.com/cosson
]

--

.smaller[
- When we try to compute the 40<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number:
    - the code on the left takes __430 milliseconds__
    - the code on the right takes __~0.003 milliseconds__

- BUT, the code on the left appears so much simpler

### Group Discussion (5 minutes): Why do we care so much about programs being fast?

- Turn to the people around you and introduce yourself. 

- In groups of 2-4 people discuss why you think it
is important for the programs to run fast.

- You should think about it from two different perspectives:
    - why do **you** want a program on your computer to work fast?
    - why is it beneficial to the **society** if the programs run fast?
(this one is a bit more challenging)
